# CCIP + v4 HOOK swap

This is for the project which wants to launch its tokens on the ETH mainnet for discovery and availability and will now still be able to access the accessibility and cheap Fees of L2. Not only that but with CCIP + hook, the ease for the end user is as good as it goes as there is no switching and hopping on five other platforms, now it can be done from one platform with one click!
